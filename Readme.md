Hello,

Please find my Module 10 submission alongwith the resources folder including all pertinent csv and sqlite files.

Main folder includes the climate notebook and the starter api python file.

Module was working in a study group with Lucas Perez, Rob Molenda and Sultan Raheem.

Appreciate your time!
